Project Description:
  During my second year I was tasked with writing a simple implementation of a binary search tree in my Data Structures course ,
  here is the project description and instructions :
  
1) You are to write a class named BST, representing a Binary Search Tree. This tree is composed of nodes that are 
represented by the class TreeNode. The TreeNode class must have a data field, which is an integer. You may 
assume that this integer is in the range [0,99].
2) BST class must have a constructor, which creates an empty tree.
2) BST class must have a method
void insert(int x),
which inserts a TreeNode with data field x to the tree.
3) BST class must have a method
void delete(int x),
which deletes at least one TreeNode with data field x from the tree. If a TreeNode with data field x does not 
exist, it does nothing.
4) BST class must have a method
void draw(),
which appropriately draws the tree on a Swing frame or panel as follows, representing each node by a circle and 
writing its data on it, together with the edges between the nodes. You may assume that the depth of the tree is at 
most 5. You donâ€™t have to color the nodes and the edges. Just show the structure of the tree along with the data.
